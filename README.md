Heroku Symfony2 build pack
========================

This build pack is used to bundle Symfony2-based webapps and PHP-FPM+Nginx server for Heroku apps.

WARNING : READ ME!
-------------
This build pack is a brand new build pack, written to upgrade the old (but working!) Simple IT's Symfony2 build pack (https://github.com/simpleit/heroku-buildpack-sdz) which is strongly coupled & linked to their own app.

**This build pack is under development. It's not complete and stable.**

**DON'T USE THIS BUILDPACK UNTIL IT'S STABLE! (documentation will be updated when it will be usable)**

_This README will be completed soon..._
